KeshUI: A Unreal Engine 4 C++ Based UI Framework
================================================

Note: I add to this library as and when I need things. If you use it and find something missing, feel free to add or request it (if it's a feasably small addition.)

Interface Class Hierarchy
=========================

KUIInterface (receives external events and creates its own; dispatches events to containers)

KUIInterfaceElement (controls location and z-ordering)
 |
 |- KUIInterfaceComponent (direct rendering calls.)
 |
 \- KUIInterfaceContainer (receives and dispatches all events to children - used to group widgets and other containers together)
     |
     \- KUIInterfaceWidget (selective event receipt - used to implement specific interface elements)

KUIInterfaceWidgetChildManager (links to a component inside a widget for widget-specific child info)

Note: Child managers are an idea I played around with to have state-agnostic generic classes with state managers. I don't really use them any more.


Interface Ownership Hierarchy
=============================

KUIInterface
 |
 \- Root containers (root/overlay/tooltip/cursor)
     |
     \- Child containers <--------<---------<---\
         |                                      |
         |- More containers (for layout.) -->---/
         |
         |- Components (for direct rendering.)
         |
         \- Widgets (for specific interface elements.)
             |
             \- WidgetChildManager

Containers can contain either components (for direct rendering) or other containers and widgets.
Events are not dispatched directly to components, they only handle draw calls.
Do not overload on standard containers, or event dispatching will take unneeded cpu cycles.
